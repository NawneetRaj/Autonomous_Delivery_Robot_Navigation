# Autonomous Delivery Robot Navigation 

Welcome to **Autonomous Delivery Robot Navigation**, a Python-based simulation that demonstrates an autonomous delivery robot navigating a dynamic environment with buildings, obstacles, and delivery tasks. The simulation visualizes every stage of the robotâ€™s journey and tracks comprehensive performance metrics.

## Project Overview

This project simulates an **autonomous delivery robot** that navigates a 2D grid environment with:

- Multiple buildings and obstacles
- Pickup and delivery tasks
- Battery management
- Real-time path replanning when obstacles appear

The robot uses **A\*** pathfinding with Manhattan distance heuristic to navigate efficiently. It continuously updates its metrics and visualizes **every stage** of its journey.
